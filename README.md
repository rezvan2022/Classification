# Classification
Some samples sub routines that have been deployed during  building and optimization of an imbalance classification problem in a financial sector firm.
The process has some major steps:
-- input data processing; selecting the type of input, cleaning data and outliers and statistical analysis for finding the most important features.
-- implementing different models of classification and investigating the accuracy and repeatability and stability of results in majority and minority classes and overally
-- implementing differernt optimization methods for feature selection and for maximizing minority class accuracy, stability and minimizing the difference in accuracy of different classes.
-- implementing different methods such as changing features, using cost matrix, and using algorithm that can overcome data set imbalance-ness issues
-- post processing model results in order to calculated the actual probability for different sectors.
-- validation with cross fold, over test dataset and out sample data.
